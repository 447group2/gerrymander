# gerrymander

All of the code I wrote exists in main.py.
I had some issues with uploading the shapefiles since github said they were too big.
I managed to download the state borders shapefile as well as a CSV with the coordinate ranges of each state.

Here is how my file structure looked in pycharm when I had all of the files store locally:

main.py
rivers/USA_Rivers_and_Streams.shp
state_shapes/cb_2018_us_state_500k.shp
             statebounds.csv
data/tl_2018_us_cd116.shp

The rivers directory contained the major rivers shapefile.
The state_shapes directory contained the state borders shapefile as well as a CSV with the coordinate ranges of each state.
The data directory contained the US districts shapefile.
